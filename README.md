# Minutes
This is my toy project to learn Vue.js. The goal is to build an interface similar to Slack, but one which is optimized for taking meeting minutes instead of chatting.

## Gettings started
    git clone https://github.com/stefanhengl/vue-minutes.git
    cd vue-minutes
    npm install
    npm start
